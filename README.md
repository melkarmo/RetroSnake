# RetroSnake

This project is a Java implementation of an arcade-like version of the famous Snake game.

The code is very basic, clean and easy to undestand, and makes great use of object-oriented programming principles.  
The graphical user interface was made using basic SWING and AWT components, which were very adequate to easily render retro arcade-like visuals.

The game is played the directional pad for moving, and the space bar for selecting and pausing.

*Environment :* NetBeans IDE 8.2, JDK 1.8, SWING/AWT
